# EC530_Peer-to-Peer-Project

This is a hackathon project in which I created a chat system in python that allows people to communicate with each other in real time. It uses a server and client connection.

The function and features of this system are:
- Multiple clients can message on the same server. 
- Asynchronous send/receive using threading.
- All connected users recieve/see the messages on the server in real time. 
- Users can input any username to easily display who is messaging.
- Timestamps shown to all messages.
- The SQLite database logs all chat messages.
